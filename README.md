# hello-github
I am new to GitHub. I hope I found myself enjoyed here.

I am a fan on programming but my major is far from this. So I decide to learn by myselves and all selfless contributors online.
For now, I am interested in Python. Hope I can develop some projects in the future, such as prodcitvity apps or games.
I found using Linux is really cool recently. Although I used Windows all the time and I still need to use it for regular working in like 5 years at least, I still want to learn how to master Linux.

Thanks advanced if you have any experience want to share with me.
